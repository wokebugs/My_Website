        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="image/me.jpg" alt="photo of myself" class="me">
        <p>Hello! My name is Dannica but I go by Dani or Dan. I am a 20 year old Filipino-American that grew up in a
            military lifestyle. Until 2019, I have been moving around the majority of my life. I was born in Yokosuka,
            Japan where I first spent the first 2-3 years of my life. I then moved to San Diego, Califirnia and lived
            there for 2 years. Afterwards, my family and I moved back to Japan, this time in Misawa and stayed there
            for 4 years. After spending a small amount of my elementary there, we moved to Mississippi where I spent the
            majority of elementary schooling, and lived there for about 3 years. Afterwards, we moved to Napoli, Italy
            and spent my middleschool and first 1 and a half years of high-school at and I lived there for 4 and a half
            years. After
            living overseas for a majority of my life, we decided to settle in Washington!</p>
        <br>
        <p>After spending many years in many different environments, I picked up a few interests and hobbies! </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Snowboarding</strong></li>
                <li>I got into snowboarding from my dad when we were stationed in Misawa, Japan. Almost every year we go
                    snowboarding! So far I've been snowboarding in Japan, Italy, California, Germany, and Swedan
                </li>
                <li><strong>Collecting Trinkets</strong></li>
                <li>Every since I was a child, I really loved collecting things! As a kid, I liked collecting pins and
                    hats, but most recently I have been collecting albums, blind boxes such as Smiskis or stuff from Pop
                    Mart, stationary, Miffy and Line Brown
                    bear merchandise, and stickers of course.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Singing and Making Playlists</strong></li>
                <li>I was a very shy person growinh up and I wasn't very confident athletically or academically, but I
                    found comfort in singing. I did choir in Middle-school as well as Highschool and my senior year I
                    was given the "Student Director" award. Because of choir, I have become a much more confident person
                    as a whole :)! Because I have a huge passion for music, I also enjoy making playlists on my free time as well as attending concerts!
