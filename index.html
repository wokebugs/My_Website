        <p class="header">I have been interested in collecting stickers ever since I was a kid and got inspired by
            my sister. I currently
            own <strong>hundreds</strong> of sticker sheets
            and many many singualar stickers as well!</p>
        <p class="header"> I started collecting stickers as a hobby last year. I try to attend as many events as
            possible that would be
            selling these goods. I recently bought a bunch of stickers from Sakura-Con 2024! I spend about $80 on
            stickers, using them to give out as gifts, decorate my personal items such as my phone, laptop, and
            notebooks, as well as decorating personalized letters.</p>

            <li>I like to decorate things such as my phone, notebooks, and my laptop</li>
            <li>While journaling, I like to decorate the pages so they don't look too bland</li>
            <li>I think stickers give items more <em>personality</em> and it's fun to customize personal things with
                them</li>
