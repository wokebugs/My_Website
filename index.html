        <p class="first_text">I have been interested in collecting stickers ever since I was a kid and got inspired by
            my
            sister. I currently
            own <strong>hundreds</strong> of sticker sheets
            and many many singualar stickers as well!</p>

        <h2>What I use stickers for!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to decorate things such as my phone, notebooks, and my laptop</li>
            <li>While journaling, I like to decorate the pages so they don't look too bland</li>
            <li>I think stickers give items more <em>personality</em> and it's fun to customize personal things with
                them</li>
