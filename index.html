            <p class="header-text">I have been interested in collecting stickers ever since I was a kid and got inspired
                by my sister. I currently own <strong>hundreds</strong> of sticker sheets and many singular stickers as
                well!</p>
            <p class="header-text">I started collecting stickers as a hobby last year. I try to attend as many events as
                possible that would be selling these goods. I recently bought a bunch of stickers from Sakura-Con 2024!
                I spend about $80 on stickers, using them to give out as gifts, decorate my personal items such as my
                phone, laptop, and notebooks, as well as decorating personalized letters.</p>

        <h2>What I use stickers for!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to decorate things such as my phone, notebooks, and my laptop</li>
            <li>While journaling, I like to decorate the pages so they don't look too bland</li>
            <li>I think stickers give items more <em>personality</em> and it's fun to customize personal things with
                them</li>
