        <h1>Sakura-Con 2024 ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡</h1>

        <p>
            I recently went to Sakura-con! It took place at the <a href="https://sakuracon.org/" target="_blank">
                Seattle Convention Center </a>.
            There were SOOO many vendors! The con was held in two different buildings: Summit and Arch at
            705 Pike. </p>
        <p>
            There were vendors selling anime merch and goodies, props, clothes, but most importantly, <b>stickers.</b>
        </p>

        <p>My favorite stickers that I ended up buying were three car peekers from <a
                href="https://ahhgela.com/collections/peekers" target="_blank">Ahhgela.</a> They were pretty reasonably
            priced and I believe there was a buy 3 for
            $15. Considering the price and quality, it was a REALLY good deal. I ended up buying Miffy, Tomagotchi
            Mametchi, and NewJeans decals for my car. I haven't put them on my car yet though but plan to soon! </p>
